| Patch for non-critical issues | Within 90 days |
| Public disclosure | After patch + minimum 30 days post-deployment |

## Disclosure Policy

- **Strict coordinated disclosure**: Do NOT publicly disclose any vulnerability until an official patch has been released and a minimum of 30 days has passed since the fix was deployed.
- Premature disclosure may result in legal action under applicable IP protection and computer fraud laws.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release and the default branch (`main` or `master`) receive security updates. Older versions are not supported.

## Security Standards

This project enforces the following security practices:

1. **No secrets in code**: API keys, tokens, passwords, and credentials must NEVER be committed to the repository.
2. **Dependency auditing**: Dependencies are regularly reviewed for known vulnerabilities.
3. **Least privilege**: All automations, workflows, and integrations operate with minimum required permissions.
4. **Branch protection**: The default branch requires pull request reviews before merging.
5. **Signed commits**: Contributors are encouraged to sign commits with GPG keys.
6. **No unauthorized data collection**: This project does not collect, store, or transmit user data without explicit consent.

## Prohibited Actions

The following actions are strictly prohibited and may result in legal action:

- Unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or data
- Exploiting vulnerabilities beyond minimal proof-of-concept demonstration
- Exfiltration, modification, or destruction of data
- Reverse engineering of proprietary algorithms or trade secrets
- Denial of service attacks
- Automated vulnerability scanning without prior written consent
- Social engineering or phishing attacks against maintainers or users

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible security research. If you comply with this policy:

- We will not pursue legal action against you
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
